This the reposetory for my CFD code (POSEIDON). The first developement was done in MATLAB. Now I am converting it to C++ using PETSc libraries.

Poseidon is a solver for incompressible and laminar Navier-Stokes equations. This code is validated and used for my PhD work on shape sensitivity analysis for fluid-solid interaction simulations. Poseidon is based on the Immeresed Boundary (IB) method for modeling the solid boundaries and continuum sensitivity analysis (CSA) for sensitivity calculation. The sensitivity analysis is verified using Complex Step metod.
